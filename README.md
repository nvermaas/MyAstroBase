# AstroBase Server

A lightweight Astrophotography pipeline.
Raw images are submitted to astrometry.net for positioning in the sky and meta data extraction.
The metadata and images are stored in a database and on a backend filesystem and can be accessed by a REST API.

The backend has a basic GUI, and can use the Django Admin application.
